Open the database musicals.sqlite with sqlite3.

Run the .schema command. What are the three "create table" commands used to create the database tables?

CREATE TABLE "authors" ("id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY  AUTOINCREMENT  NOT NULL , "name" VARCHAR) ;
CREATE TABLE "authors_musicals" ("author_id" INTEGER,"musical_id" INTEGER) ;
CREATE TABLE "musicals" ("id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY  AUTOINCREMENT  NOT NULL , "title" VARCHAR, "year" INTEGER) ;


[Write an SQL select command to produce the titles of all the musicals in the database that were first staged in the 1940s. What was the command? What were the results?]

SELECT musicals.title FROM musicals WHERE year >= 1940 and year < 1950 ;

Write an SQL select command to produce the titles of all the musicals authored by Oscar Hammerstein. What was the command? What were the results?

SELECT musicals.title FROM authors, authors_musicals, musicals WHERE authors.name = "Oscar Hammerstein" and authors.id = authors_musicals.author_id and musicals.id = authors_musicals.musical_id

Oklahoma!
South Pacific
Carousel
The Sound of Music

From this point forward, you may use either sqlite3 from the command line or the SQL Manager add-on to Firefox

Insert two new musicals, with their authors and the proper linkage. The musicals are:

Music Man	1957	Meredith Wilson
Hello, Dolly!	1964	Jerry Herman
Hello, Dolly!	1964	Michael Steward

What SQL commands were executed to completely insert the information for Music Man?

INSERT into authors (name) values ("Meredith Wilson") ;
INSERT into musicals (title, year) values ("Music Man", 1957) ;
INSERT into authors_musicals (author_id, musical_id) values ((SELECT authors.id FROM authors WHERE authors.name = "Meredith Wilson"), (SELECT musicals.id FROM musicals WHERE musicals.title = "Music Man")) ;


Create a new table called Actresses with an auto-increment primary key id (integer) and the actress’s name (a string). Populate the table with the following actresses:
Carol Channing
Pearl Bailey
Shirley Jones
Mitzi Gaynor
Mary Martin
Julie Andrews
Cyd Charisse
Audrey Hepburn
Agnes Moorhead
Gwen Verdon
Janis Paige

CREATE TABLE "actresses" ("id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY  AUTOINCREMENT  NOT NULL , "name" VARCHAR) ;

Create a new linking table called "actresses_musicals" with two integer keys, actress_id and musical_id, and show the SQL command that was executed.

CREATE TABLE "actresses_musicals" ("actress_id" INTEGER, "musical_id" INTEGER) ;

Set up the following links between actresses and musicals in the actresses_musicals table:

Carol Channing	Hello, Dolly!
Pearl Bailey	Hello, Dolly!
Mary Martin	South Pacific
Mitzi Gaynor	South Pacific
Shirley Jones	Oklahoma!
Cyd Charisse	Brigadoon
Shirley Jones	Carousel
Audrey Hepburn	My Fair Lady
Julie Andrews	My Fair Lady
Julie Andrews	The Sound of Music

INSERT into actresses_musicals (actress_id, musical_id) values ((SELECT actresses.id FROM actresses WHERE actresses.name = "Carol Channing"), (SELECT musicals.id FROM musicals WHERE musicals.title = "Hello, Dolly!")) ;

Finally, execute an SQL command to list the names of all the actresses who were ever in a play authored by Oscar Hammerstein. Note that this requires a join across all five tables in the database!

SELECT DISTINCT actresses.name FROM actresses, actresses_musicals, authors, authors_musicals, musicals where actresses.id = actresses_musicals.actress_id and authors.id = authors_musicals.author_id and authors_musicals.musical_id = musicals.id and authors_musicals.musical_id = actresses_musicals.musical_id and authors.name = "Oscar Hammerstein" ;

Mary Martin
Mitzi Gaynor
Shirley Jones
Julie Andrews
