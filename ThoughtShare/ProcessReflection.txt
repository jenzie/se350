Rails – Thought Share

Name: Jenny Zhen

================================================================
Level 1 – Start
Estimated Time	35 minutes
Plan for this level:
Read the rails documentation on how to do validation. Specifically, look for ways to 
check the minimum/maximum length for strings, uniqueness of strings, and regex to 
format strings.

Level 1 – Complete
Actual Time	40 minutes
Ratio           1.14

Explanation for ratio:
I couldn't get the regex to work the first couple of times.

Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
I couldn’t understand how to use regex to validate the name for the thinker. It took a little 
longer to test the regex used to make sure that “the name can only include uppercase 
letters, lowercase letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes. The name must 
start with an uppercase or lowercase letter.” I did a bunch of tests before the final regex 
was correct. I had no problem with any of the other validations needed.
================================================================
Level 2 – Start
Estimated Time	10 minutes
Plan for this level:
I need to locate where the problem is for the “Mine” filter of thoughts. Basically, I need to 
find where the code is for the  thinker and show only the active thinker.

Level 2  – Complete
Actual Time	10 minutes
Ratio    1.00       

Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

I didn't realize that I wasn't refreshing the page properly to show the thoughts under the 
"mine" filter. I had to click on the users in the dropdown menu to refresh the active user 
and reload the "mine" filter.

The solution is located in "ThoughtShare/app/controllers/thoughts_controller.rb".
The two lines of code are:
elsif session[:show] == 'mine'
  #Show only thoughts for the active user
  @thoughts = Thought.where(:thinker_id => @active_thinker.id)
================================================================
Level 3 – Start
Estimated Time	1 hour
Plan for this level:
Create a page for the thumbers who have thumbed a thought.
  Add a thumbers method to the thoughts controller.
  Add a file to the thoughts view.
Must make the new page have the same look and feel as the previous pages, without 
duplicating code.

Level 3 – Complete
Actual Time	1 hour 20 minutes
Ratio           1.33

Explanation for ratio:
Couldn't get the json routing to work properly to redirect the thumbers to the view because 
I had no previous experience with json. It kept on redirecting in an endless loop.

Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
I couldn't figure out how to do json while trying to figure out how to write html code again. 
Also, I didn't figure out how to get the id of the thought that was being passed in until after 
searching on Google for how to get the parameters inside the supposed hash. The SQL 
command to find the names of thumbers for a thought was still moderately difficult.
================================================================
Level 4 – Start
Estimated Time	20 minutes
Plan for this level:
Add the email attribute to the Thinker model.
	Create a database migration.
	Validate input using regex for an email.
Add the email field to the new Thinker page.
Show the email on the thinker's profile page.

Level 4 – Complete
Actual Time	18 minutes
Ratio           0.90

Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
Had to use the command 
	"rails generate migration AddEmailToThinker email:string"
to add the email column to the Thinker table.
For that change to be applied, I had to use the command "rake db:migrate"
which I didn't remember the first time.
Modifying the view to include the email in the new Thinker, edit Thinker, and Thinker 
profile was fairly straightforward.
================================================================
Level 5 – Start
Estimated Time	15 minutes
Plan for this level:
Add validation with incrementing the number of thumbs for a given thought. The same user 
cannot thumb the same thought more than once. If the user tries to thumb a thought they 
have already thumbed, the thumb attempt is ignored.

Level 5 – Complete
Actual Time	19 minutes
Ratio           1.26

Explanation for ratio:
Was not getting the id of the active user for the Thumb.exists? check.

Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
Still need a bit of learning to get more familiar with Rails sql commands. Didn't have to 
add much code to check for the uniqueness of the thumb. Just had to check if the thumb 
entry existed in the database for the given thought and user.
================================================================
Overall Summary
Estimated Total Time	2 hours 20 minutes
Actual Total Time	2 hours 47 minutes
Ratio           1.19

Assessment of ratio:
Throughout the project, the time for a lot of the levels were underestimated. I did not 
complete most of the levels within the estimated time. The only two levels with a ratio 
of 1.00 and below were level 2 and 4, with ratios of 1.00 and 0.90 respectively. I learned 
from the ratios that I should plan more time for each task that needs to be completed, 
especially if I am working on a project in which I am still learning the language.

Project reflection:
Overall, I feel that I learned quite a bit. I haven't touched relational databases again until 
recently. My memory was still foggy on how the commands work. Working with little to 
none recovered knowledge of relational databases, I also had to work with it in a Rails, 
Ruby, and HTML environment. This made it exceptionally difficult because my previous 
knowledge of web applications, in general, was from too long ago to be recalled easily. 
I feel that this project gave a decent introduction to how Rails works. I learned more 
about Ruby in the previous Ruby Diet Manager project because that one actually focused 
on the Ruby language. Whereas, this project was a blend of Rails, Ruby, and HTML. 
The parts of the project that were particularly difficult was the Rails sql commands and 
regex for the input validation. Not much of the Rails language and Rails' way to work with 
relational databases was explained in class. So, a lot of the project required Googling 
and reading through code that was given. I feel that a better introduction to Rails in the 
classroom would've been better for this project. Additionally, more time should've been 
planned for this project because it felt like a last minute project with less than a week 
to complete.
